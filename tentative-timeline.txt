a. Comparison Across Types of User Groups:

Over the next week (10/11 - 10/18)

	1. Match the user number to user handle.

	2. Redo transCSSR with model selection for the L parameter.

	3. Split the data into a training and a testing set.

		80% of weeks for training and 20% of weeks for testing.

		104 weeks (two years) for training and 14 weeks for testing

	4. Train the models for both epsilon-machine and seasonal on the training set.

(10/18-10/25)

	5. Get out probabilities from the models evaluated on the testing set.

		Get this for free from the GAM.

		Get this from transCSSR.
			Dave will show Odalys how to do this.

	6. Evaluate those probabilities on the testing set.

		Dave will explain how to do this.

(10/25-11/1)

	7. Compare seasonal to self-driven:

		Between different user types.

(11/1-11/8)

	8. Get out statistical summaries of user behaviors and compare between different types of users.

...

Teach Odalys how all the models work.

b. Pre-Post Viral TikTok Comparison

	1. Fit a model to the data pre- / post- virality.

	2. Compare those two models:

		a. Seasonal versus Self-driven

		b. Summaries of user behavior (like entropy rate.)
